# CollectCalls javascript library.
Collects functions that should be called in the future.

While loading a script, it might have dependencies that prevents it from executing right away. CollectCalls can collect functions and call at a later time, for example when jQuery and all dependencies has loaded. Mostly useful for web pages, where generated code may scatter <script> tags, not for plugins.

## Basic usage
jQuery is loaded at the bottom of the page, but <script> tags are generated by page parts. The <script> tags will only enqueue functionality until jQuery has loaded.

```html
<script>
	// Code that is written now, but executed later
	// This can be anywhere on the page

	// Set up, or reuse, a queue built as an array object
	var runWithJQuery = runWithJQuery || [];

	runWithJQuery.push(function() {
		// Do some heavy lifting with jQuery
		var scriptCount = $("script").length;

		// Then show alert box
		alert("The queue is invoked. Found " + scriptCount + " script tags on the page.");
	});
</script>

 <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>

<script>
	// This code won't be executed until jQuery has been loaded.
	$(function ()
	{
		// Wrap the queue with CollectCalls
		runWithJQuery = new JoelPurra.CollectCalls(runWithJQuery);
		runWithJQuery.join();
	});
</script>
```
