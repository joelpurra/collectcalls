<p>
	This page demonstrates, in a blunt way, how scripts can block load/execution/display
	of other content/scripts/stylesheets/images on the page. There are two <code>alert()</code>
	boxes shown - one blocking and one non-blocking. Both of them are initialized in
	the middle of the page's contents, between the "first half" and the "second half".
	Using CollectCalls, the <code>alert()</code> can be deferred until the rest of the
	page and jQuery has been loaded.
</p>
<p>
	In case you wonder why jQuery and CollectCalls are not loaded at the top of the
	page, it is because it is <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/payload.html#DeferLoadingJS">
		best practice to load scripts at the bottom of the page</a>, near <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>.
	There are also other techniques/optimizations/combinations that make it hard to
	predict exactly when a script has loaded and executed, but CollectCalls can help
	manage all of them.
</p>
<h2>
	Demo modes
</h2>
<ol>
	<li><a href="demo.html">Reload and do not show any alert box.</a></li>
	<li><a href="demo.html?show-alert=blocking">Reload and show blocking alert box without
		CollectCalls.</a></li>
	<li><a href="demo.html?show-alert=non-blocking">Reload and show non-blocking alert box
		using CollectCalls.</a></li>
	<li><a href="demo.html?show-alert=blocking&show-alert=non-blocking">Reload and show
		both blocking and non-blocking alert box.</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>
	First half of the page has loaded
</h2>
<p>
	Some content <em>above</em> both inline script blocks. If you have chosen to see
	the blocking <code>alert()</code>, you can see how this demonstrates that some scripts
	are better to execute <em>after</em> the page/all scripts (or just the right scripts)
	have loaded.

	// DEMO CODE: Only run non-blocking CollectCalls queue "runWithJQuery" when asked to

<h2>
	Second half of the page has loaded

<p>
	Some content <em>below</em> both inline script blocks. If you have chosen to use
	CollectCalls to show the non-blocking <code>alert()</code>, you can see that the
	entire page has loaded before it is popping up - even though the inline script using
	jQuery was defined <em>above</em> this paragraph.

	End of page

	loaded <em>below</em> this paragraph.
